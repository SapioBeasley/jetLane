## Questions
**Need to ask**

**Asked**
- [x] Can everyone see all companies or will they only be viewable by users who are 'canView'?
- [x] If user is a client what extra fields are required for the prequal meeting
- [x] What type of values are expected for these? front_end_limit, back_end_limit, front_end_mortgate_insurence, loan_limit
- [x] What other "burnoff" items will their be?
- [x] Is "Seasoned burnoff" an actual field to be added of was it a general name?
- [x] conforming_load with a value of either y/n is a correct field? I may have caught it wrong.

**Answered**
